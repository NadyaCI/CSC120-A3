Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
I didn't consult with anyone but there were a couple times when I had a question so I went to look at the discord, and someone else had answered already

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
I didn't sadly (yet, I plan to soon to work on what I didn't finish) 

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
I like it so far, it's definitely less intuitive than python and a bit more fussy but I'm enjoying it. I really like that because its compiled(I think) you can make a method and call it earlier in the program(like I did with the response method)

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
A lot of it is fundamentally the same, figure out how to solve a problem and then tell the computer to do that. But I can definitely tell that different languages are best for different things.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
At one point I was writing out how to respond with one of the canned responses and when I extended it to respond with mirror words, I realised that I wanted to pull out everything I'd done into a seperate method. It felt a bit inefficient and if I did it again I'd have tried to think about what could be useful to have in a seperate method from the start(basically plan out the logic before I jump into coding). 
If I spent a bit more time on this I might try to put some of the comparing mirror words section in a while loop so if it gets replaced you can move on to checking the next word without having to do a bunch of unnecessary comparisons.
I also once again procrastinated a bit too much which is. Not advisable.
